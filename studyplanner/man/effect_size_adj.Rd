\title{Adjusted effect size for correlated baseline–follow-up designs}
\usage{
effect_size_adj(delta, sigma, rho)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Numeric. The expected mean difference in annual change between groups.}

\item{sigma}{Numeric (> 0). SD of the outcome at a single timepoint.}

\item{rho}{Numeric, between -1 and 1 inclusive.}
}
\value{
A single numeric: adjusted effect size d_adj.
}
\description{
Computes d_adj = Delta / (sigma * sqrt(1 - rho^2)), where Delta is the mean
difference in annual change (or other contrast), sigma is the SD of the
outcome at a single timepoint, and rho is the baseline–follow-up correlation.
}
\examples{
effect_size_adj(delta = 0.05, sigma = 0.2, rho = 0.9)

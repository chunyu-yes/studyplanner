\title{Power for two-arm study using adjusted effect size}
\usage{
power_two_arm(d_adj, n, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{d_adj}{Numeric. Adjusted effect size from \code{effect_size_adj()}.}

\item{n}{Integer (> 0). Total sample size across both arms.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric, between 0 and 1 (open interval). Two-sided alpha level.}
}
\value{
Numeric power between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Computes power = 1 - Phi(z_(1-alpha) - d_adj * sqrt(n/2)),
assuming equal allocation, two-sided alpha, and standard normal approximation.
}
\examples{
d <- effect_size_adj(0.05, 0.2, 0.9)
power_two_arm(d, n = 100, alpha = 0.05)
}

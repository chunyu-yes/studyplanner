An R package for planning two-arm studies with cost and power considerations.  
This package implements helper functions to calculate adjusted effect size, statistical power, sample size, study cost, and to optimize designs under budget constraints.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Clone the repo and install locally:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jh-adv-data-sci/project-4-r-packages-chunyu-yes", subdir = "studyplanner")
```

## Usage

```r
library(studyplanner)

# Adjusted effect size for correlated baseline-follow-up design
d <- effect_size_adj(delta = 0.05, sigma = 0.2, rho = 0.9)

# Power calculation
power_two_arm(d, n = 100, alpha = 0.05)

# Required sample size for 90% power
sample_size_two_arm(d, alpha = 0.05, target_power = 0.9)

# Study cost (fixed costs= baseline $3000 + 1-year $2000=$5000, cost_per_subject=MRI$5000*2=$10000)
study_cost(n = 100, cost_per_subject = 10000, fixed_costs = 5000)

# Optimize under budget
optimize_under_budget(d, alpha = 0.05, budget = 1000000, cost_per_subject = 10000)

# High-level helper
study_planner(delta = 0.05, sigma = 0.2, rho = 0.9,
              alpha = 0.05, target_power = 0.9,
              budget = 1000000, cost_per_subject = 10000)
```
